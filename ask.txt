I have a dataset for phishing url. These are the columns available in the dataset: 
	
url_length, valid_url, at_symbol, sensitive_words_count, path_length, isHttps, nb_dots, nb_hyphens, nb_and, nb_or, nb_www, nb_com, nb_underscore	target


Can you create a python program based on machine learning, using the dataset, to detect phishing websites. From the dataset, if target is 1, the website is legitimate, if label is 0, the website is a phishing website. Thereafter, output whether the website is legitimate or suspicious



I have a dataset for phishing url. These are the columns available in the dataset: 
	
Url, Label, having_IP_Address, URL_Length, Shortining_Service, Prefix_Suffix, having_Sub_Domain, URL_Depth, Domain_registeration_length, Favicon, SFH, age_of_domain, DNSRecord, web_traffic

And this is what each column means:
having_IP_Address: mark as 1 if url contains ip address, and -1 if there is no ip address
URL length: mark as 1 if url length exceeds 50, 0 if it is between 30 to 50.
Shortining_Service: mark as 1 if url shortening services have been used
Prefix_Suffix: mark as 1 if url have prefix and suffix, if not -1
having_Sub_Domain: mark as 1 if url have too many subdomains
Domain_registeration_length: Scan any suspicious behaviors related to domain registration details.
Favicon: Scan any suspicious behaviors related to favicons.
SFH: 1 if there is sfh
age_of_domain: 1 if the age of domain is less than a year
DNSRecord: 1 if there is dns record
web_traffic: response code 200


Can you create a python program based on machine learning, using the dataset, to detect phishing websites. The program will ask for url input. From the dataset, if Label is 0, the website is legitimate, if label is 1, the website is a phishing website. Thereafter, output whether the website is legitimate or suspicious, also output the random forest classifier tree diagram
